List of Current Bugs:
-----------------------------------
Reset button is a little glitchy, moves blocks a little bit off from specified location
reason: Idk but I think it's caused because the original blocks arent removed fast enough
Solution: Try copying the Ghost source code because I think it has a structure that prevents this
also maybe try using Ghost source code's director class
Also it could be caused by the physics, try pausing in the levelloader and then starting the physics again
---------------------------------
DISABLE HOME BUTTON AND RESET BUTTON WHILE TOTEM BREAK TIMER IS ON, OTHERWISE YOU GET WEIRD DOUBLE RESETS AND STUFF
---------------
1x1 explosive blocks = Insane burst force
1x4 explosive blocks = barely any?
-------------
Weird glitch where bomb block sometimes doesnt apply force, repeat by removing middle block and then clicking indestructable block hitbox where somewhat over bomb block?
REASON: Actually caused because theres no blocks around the explosive block, so nothing is affected, somewhat working as intended
----------------
Releasing a dragged object when the totem hits the ground at the right time, causes the totem hitting the ground reset timer to not work [ONLY SOMETIMES]
hard to replicate
----------------
To Add:
Add an onscreen timer so players can see how many more seconds till it's considered a win
